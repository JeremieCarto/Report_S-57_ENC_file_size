## Report S-57 ENC file size


### Summary:  
This process model will assist ENC compilers by providing them with the size of a future export and ensure, prior to exporting, that the recommended size of 50 KB for ENC updates or 5 MB for base cells is not exceeded.

### Note:  
#### CARIS HPD 5.0.2 is required to execute the process model. To be compatible with earlier versions, Create HPD URI tool must be replaced with an equivalent method to create the URI.
